# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented in this file. The format is
based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and this
project follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Dedicated test coverage for per-deme island sizes (`N` as a length-`d`
  array): a per-deme drift-variance statistical test, an end-to-end engine
  run that bounds every generation's per-deme support by its own `N_i`,
  an engine-level check that `deme_weighting: size` uses actual per-deme
  sizes rather than an equal split, a params test bounding
  `initial_allele_count` by the smallest configured `N_i`, and a CLI test
  running a config with `N` as a list.

### Changed

- Updated the simulator design document (§9, §12) to record that unequal
  deme sizes shipped in the very first `SimulationParams` implementation
  rather than remaining deferred, and to point at the new tests and
  `doc/configuration.md` as the supporting evidence and user-facing
  contract.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-08-16

### Added

- Deterministic finite island model simulation with migration, infinite-alleles
  mutation, genetic drift, and configurable convergence monitoring.
- Incremental JSON Lines persistence for every generation, replayable manifests,
  final differentiation reports, and headless visualizations.
- Command-line workflows for initialization, simulation, persisted-trajectory
  analysis, version reporting, and opt-in update checks.
- Python library API, deterministic tests, local quality gates, release
  packaging, and user and maintainer documentation.

### Fixed

- Moved default starter configurations and run artifacts from the user
  `Documents` directory to the portable, space-free `project-root/results/`
  directory.
- Added repository-local Python, Ruff, mypy, pytest, API-documentation, and
  PyInstaller wrappers so `./build --ci` works without activating a virtual
  environment.
- Made the Git-hook installer portable to native macOS utilities.
- Constrained Pyparsing to the warning-free line supported by Matplotlib 3.9.
- Made API generation enumerate every source module explicitly so Linux and
  macOS editable installs produce identical documentation.
